This is my blog, https://learnwithdaniel.com, on VuePress. 

- All articles are written in Markdown and can be found on `/blog/_posts`.
- There are basically two template files, both in `/blog/.vuepress/theme/layouts`;
- Settings file is `/blog/.vuepress/config.js`;
- CSS framework is `TailwindCSS`;
- After cloning this repo, install the npm packages: `yarn install`;
- To run in dev mode: `yarn dev`;
- To build for production: `yarn build`;
- There's a GitHub action that automatically triggers `yarn build` on commits to `main`;
