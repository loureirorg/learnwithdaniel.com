Hi, my name is Daniel.
<!-- more -->

I believe the best way to learn is to teach – yeah, it didn't work well for Seneca the Younger and his pupil Nero the Psyko – "[Docendo discimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docendo_discimus)", but I digress.

Anyway, this is why I created this blog. To burn Rome? No, are you crazy?! To learn. I will set goals for things I want to learn (usually software related things, so don't expect pole-dance things) and I will post my findings here: *tutorials*, *how to's*, *failures*, *successes*, and so on.

This original idea, of creating a teach-to-learn blog, was ~~shamelessly stolen~~ inspired by the "[Learn With Jeff](http://learnwithjeff.com)" blog, hence the title.

## About me

- I have been working as a professional software developer since 2002;
- I started 2 companies in the past (a [Groupon clone](http://www.kingcompras.com.br/), and a [digital agency](http://float.ag/)) – both went broke;
- I went four times to college: Business Administration, Information Systems, Computer Sciences, Automation Engineering – I never concluded any of them;
- I love to learn;
- New is exciting;

That's all folks. You can know me better reading my posts and checking my contacts on the page footer.
