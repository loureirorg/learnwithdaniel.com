Let's add PHPUnit testing to your WordPress plugins.
<!-- more -->

<!-- ## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of PHPUnit
- Recommended course: [Udemy - PHP Unit Testing with PHPUnit](https://www.udemy.com/course/php-unit-testing)

## Install PHPUnit

Go to the plugin root folder and install PHPUnit:

```bash
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit 7
```

::: warning
Currently, WordPress only supports phpunit version 7.
:::

## Create a testing database

Let's create a new database for testing.

::: danger
Do NOT use the same database as your WordPress website.
It will ERASE your website!!!
:::

```bash
mysql -u root
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE test_db;
```

::: tip
For local testing, you can create a single generic `test` database for all your WP projects.
